## Skills & Expertise

#### When I began blockchain development, I first studied dapps (decentralized applications) and smart contract programming. But more recently I have become fascinated by the underlying protocol layer and its surrounding infrastructure.
#### Among other projects, I'm now focused on building custom schemas for local storage of historical EVM chain state.
#### I run two local Ethereum nodes (consensus layer, post merge) using **Geth** and **Erigon**, in **full** and **archive** configurations respectively.
#### My language of choice is **Python**, and I'm also strong with **C++** and **JavaScript** among others.
#### I've also recently started studying Golang, with special focus on the Geth and Erigon clients, and I expect this to replace most of my **C++** usage eventually.
#### In terms of smart contract development, I am most experienced in Solidity (Ethereum) and SmartPy (Tezos). I do have some additional practice in Vyper (Ethereum) as well as in Rust (Solana), but not enough to consider myself a capable developer with these languages.
